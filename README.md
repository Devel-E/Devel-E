Hello, my name is Elijah. I am a highschool student interested in systems programming, cryptography, and datascience. 
The primary languages I use are C and Python, but I'm learning Rust as well with the help of the languages excellent community. I have about 3 years of experience with GNU/Linux, my favorite distro being Arch. I gained most of my experience through a local college and I plan to take an internship in a related field this summer. If you're new to linux or looking for someone to work on an open source with you, I'm always willing to help! Thank you for reading and please consider checking out my website (https://Devel-E.github.io).
